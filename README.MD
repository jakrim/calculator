**HiHello coding challenge!**

Here I'll document my steps taken to replicating the calculator app with basic add, subtract, multiply, and divide functionality.

_Steps:_

- Ran Expo init and chose the minimal Typescript template
- Began working on the UI
  - Started with the result container vs the buttons container - used flex to get the right height
  - Broke the screen up between the different button functions - used views and flex to do so
  - Started with the numbers 0-9 and displaying them through a FlatList on the screen before estimating their width and height
  - Repeated the process for each of the functional/arithmetic buttons
- Began working on the functionality
  - useState is holding our result number
  -

Extras:
Come back to installing and using Helvetica font as seen on real app
